<!--

Scroller unconditionally sets its skin's layout to private layout
implementation that handles the scroll policies.  Scroller skins can
only provide replacement scrollbars.  The skin's layout and
constraints or dimensions set on skin parts will not be honored.  To
gain more control over the layout of a viewport and its scrollbars,
instead of using Scroller, add them to a Group and use the ScrollBar component's
viewport property to link them together.
